# Intro to Computer Security - Group #5
James Pope, Bryan Montalvan, Aaron Roche

## Assignment Descriptions:
### Task - 4 
**Description:** our task is to develop a program named fcrypt.py capable of encrypting or decrypting files using the
Pretty Good Privacy scheme. The program should accept the desired operation, the recipientâ€™s key, an
input file, and an output file.

**Technologies and libraries used:** pycryptodome, argpase (for flags)

### Project - Milestones 1-3

**Description:** Rhe aim of this project is to familiarize you with cryptographic tools by implementing a secure file transfer
protocol, similar to the widely-used AirDrop feature in Apple devices. Throughout this project, you
will gain practical experience in various cryptographic and cybersecurity concepts, including symmetric
and asymmetric cryptography, digital certificates, public key infrastructure, mutual authentication, non-
repudiation, confidentiality, integrity protection, and password security.

**Technologies and libraries used:** Python3, pycryptodome, py-socket module
